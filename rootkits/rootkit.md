# Rootkits & Bootkits

Malware often goes to great lengths to hide its running processes and persistence
mechanisms from users. The most common tool used to hide malicious
activity is referred to as a rootkit. Rootkits can come in many forms, but most of them work by modifying the internal functionality of the OS. These modifications cause files, processes, network connections, or other resources to be invisible to other programs,
which makes it difficult for antivirus products, administrators, and security analysts to discover malicious activity. Some rootkits modify user-space applications, but the majority modify the kernel, since protection mechanisms, such as intrusion prevention systems,
are installed and running at the kernel level. Both the rootkit and the defensive mechanisms are more effective when they run at the kernel level, rather than at the user level. At the kernel level, rootkits can corrupt the system more easily than at the user level.
