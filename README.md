# Malware

### Detection

Antimalware solutions can use three types of detection mechanisms

1. **<u>Signature-based detection</u>**: static inspection of file checksums (MD5, SHA1 etc.) and presence of known strings or byte sequences in the binary,

2. **<u>Heuristic detection</u>**: (usually) static analysis of application behavior and identification of potentially malicious characteristics (e.g. use of specific functions which are usually associated with malware),

3. **<u>Sandboxing</u>**: dynamic analysis of the program which gets executed in a controlled environment (sandbox) where its actions are monitored.

### Evasion

Multiple techniques exist that evade different detection mechanisms. For example:

1. **<u>Polymorphic</u>** (or at least often recompiled) malware can defeat signature-based detection

2. **<u>Obfuscation</u>** of code flow can evade heuristics based detection

3. **<u>Conditional statements</u>** based on environmental checks can detect and bypass sandboxes

4. **<u>Encoding or encryption</u>** of sensitive information can help bypass signature-based detection as well as heuristic detection
